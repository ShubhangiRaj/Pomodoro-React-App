# Pomodoro-React-App

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

### The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### **Features of my version of Pomodoro App:**
- ```Work``` sets up a timer for 25 mins
- ```Short Break``` sets up a timer for 5 mins
- ```Long Break``` sets up a timer for 15 mins

### **Coming Up**
- Browser notification when the timer expires
- Start/Stop buttons to have more control on the timer

### **Dependencies** 
- react version - 15.4.1
- react-router version - 3.0.0
